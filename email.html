<h2>Bugs, feature requests and support</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, I don't have time to work on CrossSlide anymore, including
fixing bugs or adding features, nor to answer support requests.</p>

<p>If you are having trouble using it on your website, please do the
following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Review the Howto section at the bottom of the main page.</li>
<li>Make sure the scripts and images have the correct path and are being loaded.</li>
<li>Make sure your browser's Error Console stays clear.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you still can't get it to work, you might have to hire a Javascript
programmer or try to find help in online forums and message boards.</p>

<p>If you think you have found a bug, you can check if it's already reported in
the project's <a href='http://github.com/tobia/CrossSlide/issues'>issues page</a>
and discuss it there. Other users might be able to help you with it. I will
check the page once in a while and if some bug is really a show stopper for a
lot of people, I might find the time to look into it, but don't count on it.</p>

<p>Last but not least, CrossSlide is open source and it's being hosted on a
social programming platform, so it's very easy for anyone—either you or someone
you may hire—to fork the project and add a feature or fix a bug. This also makes
it easy to keep your version synced with future updates of my branch, or for me
to merge your contribution back in, once it's done.</p>

<p>If you still need to get in touch with me, you can find my email address in
the copyright notice at the top of the script's source code.</p>
